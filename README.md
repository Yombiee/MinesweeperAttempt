# MinesweeperAttempt
This is my attempt of creating Minesweeper using Java

### Tiles

> I will try to make a java file that is dedicated to Tiles.
> 
> It will have a int that tells what value it is (0-8 is the value surrounding the tile, -1 means the tiles is a bomb)
> 
> My main issue is that I do not know how to make it as a Jcomponent. (I will have to research it).
